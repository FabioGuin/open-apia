## Conclusion

AI systems face unique security challenges that require specialized protection mechanisms. APAI provides a comprehensive framework for implementing security controls, monitoring, and incident response procedures specific to AI systems.

Key takeaways:
1. Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
2. Use automated testing and monitoring for continuous security
3. Establish clear incident response procedures
4. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations
5. Provide regular security training for all team members
6. Continuously update security measures as threats evolve
