## Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with the **[Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md)**
2. Review **[Security Best Practices](security-best-practices.md)** for secure setup
3. Create your first simple specification
4. Validate it using the provided tools
5. Explore the **[examples directory](../examples/)** for inspiration

### For Intermediate Users
1. Review the **[OpenAPIA 0.1 Specification](openapia-0.1-specification.md)** for reference
2. Learn **[Hierarchical Composition](hierarchical-composition.md)** for complex systems
3. Study multi-agent patterns in **[Multi-Agent Systems](multi-agent-systems.md)**
4. Implement security controls from **[AI Security Considerations](ai-security-considerations.md)**

### For Advanced Users
1. Master **[Automation Integration](automation-integration.md)** for enterprise workflows
2. Implement security from **[Security Vulnerabilities](security-vulnerabilities.md)**
3. Build multi-agent systems with security controls
4. Contribute to the OpenAPIA ecosystem
