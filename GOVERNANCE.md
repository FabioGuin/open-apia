# OpenAPIA Governance

## Current Phase: Bootstrap

OpenAPIA is currently in the **Bootstrap Phase** with a single maintainer model. This governance structure is designed to be lightweight and efficient while the project establishes its foundation.

## Maintainer

**Current Maintainer**: Fabio Guin  
**Role**: Project Lead and Decision Maker

## Decision Making Process

### Bootstrap Phase (Current)

1. **Issues**: Open issues for discussion and feedback
2. **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs for implementation
3. **Review**: Maintainer reviews with community input
4. **Decision**: Maintainer makes final decisions with transparency
5. **Documentation**: All decisions are documented in issues/PRs

### Community Input

- **GitHub Issues**: Primary channel for discussions
- **Pull Requests**: Implementation proposals
- **Community Feedback**: Welcome and considered in decisions
- **Transparency**: All decisions and reasoning are public

## Transition to Community Governance

### Criteria for Transition

The project will transition to community governance when:

- **5+ active contributors** with sustained participation
- **10+ implementations** of the specification
- **Sustained community engagement** (issues, PRs, discussions)
- **Adoption** by organizations or significant projects
- **Maintainer decision** that community governance is beneficial

### Future Community Structure

When transitioning, we plan to adopt:

- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: 3-5 members
